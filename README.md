# PekoeC
A Quality-Of-Life improvement to C.

## Status
Pekoe is still in research and development stages, where the language is being planned before any attempt at the compiler is made.

Only temporary, likely broken code will be written to test lexical analysis, parser functionality, or input vs expected output.

## Language
See Language.md for language details

## Implementation
See Implementation.md for implementation notes

## Standard Library
See StandardLibrary for info on the planned standard library
